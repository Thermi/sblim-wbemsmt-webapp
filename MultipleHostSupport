Multiple Hosts Support
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The default behavior when starting the client is to connect to one host. To 
connect to multiple hosts simultaneously, do the following:

1) Add the following to /usr/share/tomcat5/conf/tomcat-users.xml :
   <role rolename="tasklauncher-admin"/> 
   before any <user username=...> statement.

2) Edit /usr/share/tomcat5/conf/tomcat-users.xml and add the tasklauncher-admin
   role to a user to grant admin authority, such as:
   <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin,manager,tasklauncher-admin"/> 

3) If Tomcat does not run as user tomcat, change the file access properties of all the files and directories
   in the /etc/sblim-wbemsmt so that the non-tomcat user has write access to it 

4) start Tomcat via /etc/init.d/tomcat5 start

5) In order to map the task with multiple target hosts containing the server
   code, go to:
   http://hostname:8080/sblim-wbemsmt-webapp/admin (where hostname needs to be
   replaced by the hostname of the system on which the above client packages 
   were installed). Please login with the user data from 2) above.

6) Add multiple hosts and relation to Tasks with "Edit Hosts". Map the tasks to
   the host by clicking the tasks check-box. 

7) Go to: http://hostname:8080/sblim-wbemsmt-webapp/loginMulti.jsf

8) The login screen is displayed once the displayed host is clicked.

9) Logout by selecting the host and then pressing <logout>
