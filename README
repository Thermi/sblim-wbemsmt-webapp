./webapp/*			The web application files


General Requirements
--------------------
In order to build, install and operate this package you will need a Java 
SDK or Run Time Environment depending on whether you build binaries from 
sources or use the pre-built binaries (JAR file). The following Java JDKs
are supported:

Building this package
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The build process is based on Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org). It contains 
a build.xml that allows very easy to perform a compile, produce JAR files and 
build TAR balls for a binary or a source distribution.
Additionally, an RPM spec file is in place that allows to build RPM packages.
The output of the RPM build process are RPM packages that are based on the
JPackage (http://www.jpackage.org) approach.

To be able to perform the build, set the CLASSPATH to include the JAR files
of the packages described in the 'Build-time Prerequisites. Afterwards
a Source and a Binary TAR ball can easily be built by performing the following
command:
> ant build-release
The output will be placed in the './target/release' directory.

The Source TAR ball can also be created without setting the CLASSPATH by 
simply performing:
> ant package-src-tar

With the Source TAR ball, RPM packages can be build. Since the TAR ball already
includes the RPM spec file the execution of
> rpmbuild -ta sblim-wbemsmt-webapp-<version>.src.tar.bz2
will directly build the RPM package. Be sure to ressolve the build requirements
before the build of the RPM package can take place. This is done when the 
dependent packages explained in the 'Build-time Prerequisites' have been
installed as RPM packages.


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The installation can be processed in two ways. 

The first possible installation flavour would be to use the RPM package. This
is of course our recommended way. Simply put the RPM package onto your system,
resolve the 'Run-time Dependencies' and then perform the following command:
> rpm -i sblim-wbemsmt-webapp-<version>.1jpp.noarch.rpm

The second way is a manual installation. This means the Binary TAR ball should
be taken and extracted. Copy the JAR files into the 'WEB-INF/lib' directory of
the 'sblim-wbemsmt-webapp' in your tomcat installation directory and 
additionally copy the content of the 'etc' directory into the '/etc' directory.
If you like to run the Command Line Interface script, then you should copy
the script to a location which is included into your '$PATH' environment 
variable.

Afterwards restart the tomcat server to load the new WebApplication.

Advanced Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To enable the application to be able to multiple hosts in parallel, please 
refere to the 'MultipleHostsSupport' documentation file.

In case you encounter problems please refer to the TroubleShooting file.
