SBLIM WBEMSMT Tasklauncher webapp README
----------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

The wbemsmt-webapp package provides the tasklauncher web application for 
WBEM-SMT based management tasks.


Source Package Contents
-----------------------

./README		    This file
./build.xml         Apache Ant build file
./java/*            Contains the java(tm) source files
./webapp/*			The web application files


General Requirements
--------------------
In order to build, install and operate this package you will need a Java SDK 
or Run Time Environment depending on whether you build binaries from sources
or use the pre-built binaries (JAR file). The following Java JDKs are supported:

Sun Java SDK/JRE: version 1.6.0 or higher

IBM Java SDK/JRE: version 1.6.0 or higher


Build-time Prerequisites
------------------------
Third-Party Libraries (and their dependent jar-Files):
 - sblim-cim-client 2.1.1 or later from http://www.sblim.org/
 - MyFaces 1.2.6 and Tomahawk 1.1.3 or later from http://myfaces.apache.org/
 - XMLBeans 2.4.0 from http://xmlbeans.apache.org/
 - Jakarta-Commons Lang 2.4 from http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/lang/
 - Jakarta-Commons Cli 1.1 from http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cli/
 - tomcat-6.0.18 servlet-api from http://www.apache.org/
 - tomcat-6.0.18 jsp-api from http://www.apache.org/
 - apache-log4j 1.2.15 from http://www.apache.org/


Run-time Prerequisites
----------------------
 - the above build-time preqrequisites
 - Apache Tomcat 6.0.18 or later from http://tomcat.apache.org/ and all its prerequisites
 - xerces-j2 >= 2.7.1
 - xalan-j2 >= 2.7.1
 - jakarta-commons-beanutils >= 1.8.0
 - jakarta-commons-cli >= 1.1
 - jakarta-commons-codec >= 1.3
 - jakarta-commons-digester >= 1.8
 - jakarta-commons-el >= 1.0
 - jakarta-commons-fileupload >= 1.2.1
 - jakarta-commons-lang >= 2.4
 - jakarta-commons-logging >= 1.1.1
 - tomcat6 >= 6.0.18


Run-time Preequisites
---------------------
To be able to run the task, the following AND their run-time dependencies

need to be installed properly into a Tomcat6 server:
  - sblim-wbemsmt-webapp 1.0
  - sblim-wbemsmt-commons 1.0


Building this package
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The build process is based on Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org). It contains 
a build.xml that allows very easy to perform a compile, produce JAR files and 
build TAR balls for a binary or a source distribution.
Additionally, an RPM spec file is in place that allows to build RPM packages.
The output of the RPM build process are RPM packages that are based on the
JPackage (http://www.jpackage.org) approach.

To be able to perform the build, set the CLASSPATH to include the JAR files
of the packages described in the 'Build-time Prerequisites. This can be 
accomplished with the build-jar-repository command as well. Afterwards a 
Source and a Binary TAR ball can easily be built by performing the following
command:
> ant build-release
The output will be placed in the './target/release' directory.

The Source TAR ball can also be created without setting the CLASSPATH by 
simply performing:
> ant package-src-tar


With the Source TAR ball, RPM packages can be build. Since the TAR ball already
includes the RPM spec file the execution of
> rpmbuild -ta sblim-wbemsmt-webapp-<version>.src.tar.bz2
will directly build the RPM package. Be sure to solve the build requirements
before the build of the RPM package can take place. This is done when the 
dependent packages explained in the 'Build-time Prerequisites' have been
installed as RPM packages.


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The installation can be processed in three ways. 

The preferred installation method is to run the wbemsmt setup script available
from sourceforge. 

The second possible installation method would be to use the RPM package. 
Simply put the RPM package onto your system, resolve the 'Run-time Dependencies' 
and then perform the following command:
> rpm -i sblim-wbemsmt-webapp-<version>.1jpp.noarch.rpm

The third way is a manual installation. This means the Binary TAR ball should
be taken and extracted. Copy the JAR files into the 'WEB-INF/lib' directory of
the 'sblim-wbemsmt-webapp' in your tomcat installation directory and 
additionally copy the content of the 'etc' directory into the '/etc' directory.
If you like to run the Command Line Interface script, then you should copy
the script to a location which is included into your '$PATH' environment 
variable.

Afterwards restart the tomcat server to load the tasks functionality.


Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firewall users: please ensure that port 8080 (or other port, depending on 
Tomcat's configuration) is enabled for inbound connections and that the 
standard WBEM/CIM port, 5988, is enabled for outbound connections

start Tomcat:
> /opt/apache-tomcat-6.0.18/bin/catalina.sh run

The EUI (End User Interface) can be accessed by typing the following URL into 
a web browser: http://hostname:port/sblim-wbemsmt-webapp where hostname needs 
to be replaced by the hostname of the system on which the above client packages 
were installed. The port number is typically 8080 but can vary, depending on 
Tomcat's configuration.

Once the EUI is started, in the Name field of the displayed screen enter the 
name of the host which on which the server package was installed. Typically 
the Port and Namepaces fields do not need to be changed. The User and the 
Password fields need to contain the OpenPegasus CIM user name and its password.

<-- Needs to be updated with WEBAPP info
The application will initially take some time to populate the tree on the
browser with all the defined shares, printers and users. Existing samba shares,
printers and the users can be modified by selecting them, and editing the
properties. Samba shares, printers, and users can be created (or deleted) by
selecting the Shares, Printers and Users nodes and then selecting the create
(or delete) action at the top and then selecting the update node. 
-->

Advanced Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To enable the application to be able to multiple hosts in parallel, please 
refer to the 'MultipleHostsSupport' documentation file.

In case you encounter problems please refer to the TroubleShooting file. 



Un-Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the RPM package was installed, just perform
> rpm -e sblim-wbemsmt-webapp
and things will get removed.

For manual un-installations, just remove the files you have copied into the
webapp environment and also remove the copied content of the 'etc' directory.

Afterwards please restart the tomcat server to unload the task.

The wbemsmt setup script may also be used to uninstall specific tasks.
